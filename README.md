# management-platform

Self-hosted all-in-one management app for a small Austrian start-up:

- **Buchhaltung** — Einnahmen-Ausgaben-Rechnung (cash basis): income/expense
  ledger with Austrian VAT rates (20/13/10/0 %), receipt attachments,
  monthly/yearly Auswertung with VAT overview, semicolon-CSV export for the
  Steuerberater, invoices with gapless per-year numbering (§ 11 UStG) and an
  A4 print view.
- **Projekte** — projects with kanban boards (drag & drop), tasks with
  assignees, due dates and priorities, "Meine Aufgaben" on the dashboard.
- **Wiki** — hierarchical pages with a rich-text editor (Tiptap), autosave,
  full-text search (SQLite FTS5), internal page links and backlinks.
- **i18n** — German (default) and English, switchable per user in the user menu.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

PDF uploads that need OCR require Poppler (`pdfinfo`, `pdftotext`, and
`pdftoppm`) and Tesseract to be installed locally. On Windows, install them
with your preferred package manager and restart the dev server afterwards. If
Tesseract is not on `PATH`, set `TESSERACT_PATH` in `.env.local` to its
executable (for example `C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe`). The
Docker image already includes both tools and the German/English OCR packs.

- The sign-in page accepts only a username and password. The first account
  created through the guarded `/api/auth/sign-up/email` bootstrap endpoint
  becomes the administrator.
  Afterwards public signup is disabled — admins invite people under
  *Einstellungen → Benutzer* or from **Benutzer einladen** on the profile page.
  Enter the recipient's email and role (member, personnel/accounting, or admin).
  They receive an email and choose their own nickname and password. The nickname
  is also their login username. No account exists until they finish setup.
  Invitation links expire after seven days and can create exactly one account.
  Opening or previewing a link does not consume it. Sending another invitation
  to the same address replaces the earlier link after successful email delivery.
  Pending invitations appear below the users list. Existing accounts stay intact.
  Administrators can also remove other users here. Removal revokes account access
  while retaining their name and existing business records for history.
  See [docs/user-invitations.md](docs/user-invitations.md) for email configuration.
- Migrations and default categories are applied automatically on server boot
  (`src/instrumentation.ts`). Manual commands: `npm run db:migrate`,
  `npm run db:seed`, `npx drizzle-kit studio`.
- Under *Settings → Profile → Appearance*, choose System (default), Light, or
  Dark for the whole platform. System follows operating-system changes
  automatically; the preference is remembered in the current browser.
- Configuration lives in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).

For wiki presentation editing, save recovery, live following and PDF export,
see [docs/presentations.md](docs/presentations.md).

For Wiki document saving, recovery, templates, Word import and validation,
see [docs/wiki-documents.md](docs/wiki-documents.md). Image captions, references,
figure lists and live laptop/server folder setup are covered in
[docs/wiki-figures.md](docs/wiki-figures.md).

### Schema changes

Edit the module schema (`src/modules/*/schema.ts`), re-export it from
`src/db/schema.ts`, then:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate --name <change>   # writes drizzle/NNNN_<change>.sql
npm run db:migrate
```

### Tests

```bash
npm run check   # typecheck + lint + unit tests (Vitest)
npm run e2e     # Playwright end-to-end suite
```

The e2e suite starts its own dev server on port 3100 with a throwaway
database (`data/e2e.db`). **Stop the normal dev server first** — Next.js
allows only one dev server per project.

## Deployment (Docker)

```bash
# .env next to docker-compose.yml:
#   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))">
#   BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://startup.elarbol.me
docker compose up --build -d
```

To put the application behind Cloudflare Access using the opt-in Tunnel
sidecar, follow [docs/cloudflare-access.md](docs/cloudflare-access.md).

The container stores everything under the `app_data` volume (`/data`):
`app.db` (SQLite) + `uploads/`. Put Caddy or Traefik in front for TLS.

> **Windows note:** Docker Desktop needs the WSL 2 backend. If `docker` hangs,
> install a WSL distribution first (`wsl --install`) and let Docker Desktop
> finish its first-time setup.

## Backup

The entire application state is the `/data` volume (or `./data` in dev):

```bash
sqlite3 /data/app.db ".backup /backups/app-$(date +%F).db"
rsync -a /data/uploads /backups/uploads
```

## Adding a module

1. Create `src/modules/<name>/` with `schema.ts`, `queries.ts`, `actions.ts`,
   `components/`.
2. Re-export the schema from `src/db/schema.ts` and generate a migration.
3. Add a route group under `src/app/(app)/<name>/`.
4. Register it in `src/modules/registry.ts` (sidebar) and add a `nav.<name>`
   key plus a message namespace to `messages/de.json` and `messages/en.json`.
